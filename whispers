You are a hummingbird, sucking candy from a straw.
I am a porcupine, who provides you with quills.

You are a hatchling, poking out of an egg.
I am a yolk, providing your first meal.

You are a cyborg, binding flesh to silicon.
I am the ghost in the shell.

You are a killer, a liar, and a thief.
I am a thief, a liar, and a killer.
